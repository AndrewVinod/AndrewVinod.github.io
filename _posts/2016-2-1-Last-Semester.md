title: Last Semester

This is my first blog post. So to begin I will give an update of current events in my life.

This past week I finalized my schedule for my final semester of college. This is the beginning of a bitter sweet end to a great four years of college. I frequently find myself thinking about all of the classes I've taken, people I've met, and culture I have been a part of for the past section of my life.

What are some current problems or barriers in my way from success? The backend database company, Parse, has decided to sunset their excellent product. This news was unexpected and caught me off guard. Currently I have a few iOS apps active on the app store, using this service as the backend user data storage. With school ramping up, finding time to make adjustments and converting my backend to a new service seems like a daunting task. 

Next week should be an interesting one. All of my classes are beginning to have the first assignments and projects due. The career fair is coming up, which is always exciting and nerve racking... but hopefuly will help me land a great job upon graduation. I also have a dinner with a recruiter for one of the companies I interviewed with back in January. Hey, free food is good food!

My most difficult class this semester seems like it will be cs371p. I enjoy the fact that you never know if you are going to be called on to answer questions in class. It keeps me vigilant and alert. Mr. Downing does a great job at explaining the concepts rather than just the basic definitions. For someone who has not used C++ (but has done C) code, the examples in class real give a sense on how to write clear and concise code.

Tip of the week:
  When you seem overloaded with tasks and your list only seems to grow, take a deep breath and make a plan. A plan can mark baby steps to help you accomplish your goals. When you make a list in smaller steps, you get a greater sense of acomplishment and then will to check of another task. Smaller steps are less daunting than a giant leap. The time you spend worring about something in your future, you could be proactive and achieve it.
