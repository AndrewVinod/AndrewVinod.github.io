This past week
--------------
This past week was really intense. I just finished getting back from spring break and several of my classes had projects, homeworks and/ or tests due. I attempted to finish some work over the break, while in Houston, but distractions and the fact I forgot a textbook did not help.

What is in my way
------------------
My biggest obstacle this week is a lack of time. I accepted a new job and have to get pre-employment information and criteria checked out. This work is not difficult but trying to find more time between by already busy school schedule is a challenge. As the semester continues, classes are ramping up in difficulty and consuming more time.

This upcoming week
------------------
This upcoming week should be more relaxed. I have a test to worry about, but a few good, efficient hours of studying should make me prepared. The new OOP program is available which looks interesting, since it contains object oriented concepts, based off of my quick glance over the software spec.

Experience in cs371p
--------------------
The newest program, Darwin is now available to start. This is the first project that incorporates object oriented design into the code. It should be a good check of my growing c++ knowledge. In class we covered the const keyword, which was confusing at first, but with discussion and the many examples the concept became pretty clear.

Tip of the week
----------------
My tip of the week is to always code with language documentation at hand. As I become expose to more tech, sometimes I forget simple things after not actively using them. After not using Java for about a year and needing to write programs for it again, I realized that I have forgotten some  minor things like syntax. When coding Java, I always have [Oracle docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) open whenever I forget method names, collections, any other language problem.
